# Ethical Hacking repository

This repo contains:

## CTF framework

This is my own small CTF framework for linux (mainly written in bash) which I used while playing CTFs on HackTheBox.eu or Vulnhub.
It's recommended to use it with Kali linux / other similar pentest distribution.

## Bash Color Prompts

Bash script which sets color prompt, based on https://github.com/z4ziggy/bash-powerline-ng with some modifications.
